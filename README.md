# SMART-PROCTORING-SYSTEM
In the current global scenario with covid-19, it is impossible to contact offline assessments. Providing an exam centre near the location of the student is a serious challenge. The limitation in supply of proctors and test centres can lead to extended test schedules. In online assessments without proctoring, cases are often reported of cheating and impersonation. The Face of the exam taker is captured during the online exam continuously with the help of a webcam.
